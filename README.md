# Sri-Lanka-Police-Website-Redesign
Sri Lanka Police Website Redesign UI/UX. ( Figma )

This project is a complete redesign of the official Sri Lanka Police website, crafted in Figma with a strong focus on **usability**, **accessibility**, **transparency**, and **building citizen trust**.  
The existing website was outdated, non-responsive, and difficult to navigate—especially on mobile devices—hindering quick access to essential public services.

## Purpose
To deliver a clean, modern, and fully responsive digital experience that prioritizes the needs of the public, making it easier for citizens to find important information and services efficiently and confidently.

## Design Highlights

### 🎨 Color Palette
A dark theme with a sleek, immersive interface designed to reduce eye strain during extended use.
- **Primary Accent:** Blue (conveys trust and authority)  
- **Neutral Elements:** Gray (for balance and subtlety)  
- **Text & Highlights:** White (high contrast for readability)

### ✍️ Typography
Modern, clean fonts with **bold headings** for emphasis and light body text for clarity.  
The color contrast ensures excellent legibility against the dark background, balancing professionalism with approachability.

### 🧭 Navigation
An intuitive, streamlined navigation bar offering quick access to all critical pages, designed for seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Benefits
- 📱 Enhanced mobile responsiveness  
- 👓 Improved readability and accessibility  
- 📄 Clearer presentation of public service information  
- 🤝 Increased transparency and citizen trust through user-centric design
